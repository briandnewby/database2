# database2
Database Connectivity Program
There are two applications. The DB2 application reads data from a file named customer.csv and creates a table named Customer in a database name StudentReg using SQL commands. The KYCustomers application searches the StudentReg database for customers living in Kentucky and creates a KYCustomers.txt file that is a formatted report of customers living in Kentucky with columns titled Customer#, Name, City, State, and Birthdate. The assignment also required us to use the XAMPP server with MySQL DBMS.
